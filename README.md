## Design

### Colour Scheme

We wanted to use a colour scheme that wasn't going to distract too much from the text but also make the website pop, and look fun. From the competitors websites, I found a lot of local bakeries were tending to use pastel type colours.




### Imagery

Imagery is important. The large, background image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It has a modern, energetic aesthetic also the image shows very simply and clearly the whole meaning of the web page.

### Accessibility

Whilst coding the site I have ensured that the site is accesible for all. This is achieve by using:-

* Using Google Dev tools to check contrast of items. 
* Using alt tags to describe the images on site.
* Using semantic HTML


## Technologies Used

### Languages Used 

* HTML and CSS
* JavaScript

### Software, Frameworks & Libraries Used


* [Bootstrap Version 5.3 ](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/ "Bootstrap Framework") was used to create the navigation bar, cards and form. They were modified to my suit needs. As a personal note to future myself, whilst Bootstrap is a excellent framework to get stuck into I feel it pulls away from the practising of core CSS, resulting in a lot of overriding.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons "Font Awesome 6.2.1 Free Icons") was used for the stars icons seen on the reviews page and the social media icons in the footer.
* Google Dev Tools were utilized to identify and resolve problems related to responsiveness and appearance. 
* [Github](https://github.com/ "Github") was used to store my project in a repository. 
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git Version Control") was used for Version Control.
* [Google](https://www.google.co.uk "Google Search Engine") was used to research HTML & CSS.
* [Gitpod](https:://www.gitpod.io "Gitpod Cloud IDE") the vast majority of my time was spent inside GitPod's VSCode Cloud IDE.
* CDNs [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/what-is-cloudflare/ "Cloudflare CDN") and  [JsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/ "JsDelivr") were used for Font Awesome icons CSS minified and Bootstrap 4.6 CSS minified.

### Deploying to Github Pages

* Choose the repository you want to deploy from the main overview.
* Go to settings by clicking on the icon on the menu.
* In the left navigation, select the "Pages" option.
* Under "Source", choose "Master" branch and click "Save".
* After it's done, you will see a message saying "Your site is ready to be published at (insert url here)".

### Local Development

#### How To Fork

Forking a repository is the process of creating a copy of the original repository. This enables you to make changes without affecting the main repository. 

To do so:-
* go to the GitHub repository you want to copy.
* select the 'Fork' button located in the top right corner, under your profile icon. 
* Once complete, you will now have your own version of the repository to make changes to.

#### How To Clone

To copy a GitHub repository:-
* first navigate to the repository you wish to copy. 
* click on the 'Code' button (which has a download icon) and copy the link provided.
* in the Gitpod Terminal, navigate to the directory where you wish to place the clone. Then, type 'git clone' and paste the link you copied earlier and press enter. This process can also be completed using VSCode.
